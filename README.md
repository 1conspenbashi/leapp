Leapp is a DevTool Desktop App designed to **manage and secure Cloud Access in multi-account environments.**

The App is designed to work with Cloud Providers APIs, CLIs, and SDKs.

It's a tool that securely [**stores your access information in a secure place**](.github/vault_strategy/strategy.md) and generates temporary credential sets to access your Cloud from your local machine.

> We Strongly believe that access information to Cloud in `~/.aws` or `~/.azure` files are not safe, and we prefer to store that information in an encrypted file managed by the system. 
> Credentials will be hourly rotated and accessible in those files only when they are needed, so only when Leapp is active.

# Installation
Get [here](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/releases/latest) the latest release.

# Use Cases
Our use cases are hereby presented to give you a hint on how Leapp can be of help to depend on the type of setup 
you have in your company and what kind of credentials you need to get.

## AWS Plain Access
Store AWS IAM User's Access Keys in your System Vault through Leapp. 
Leapp automatically manages **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in your AWS credentials, 
generating temporary credentials for them.

**No credentials** are stored in Leapp. 

Please see [Vault strategy](https://www.github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/vault-strategy) for more information.

![Plain Access Use-case](.github/images/plain-gif.gif)

See setup [tutorial](https://www.github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/tutorials)

*Note: it's possible to assign an MFA device to a plain session. Please see [MFA section](#multi-factor-authentication) for more details.*

## AWS Federated Access
Leverage company identity to access environment through federated single sign-on. 
Federation is established between **G Suite** and **AWS**. No more AWS credentials 
management is needed. Leapp allows you to get to cloud resources with company email and password.

![Federated Access Use-case](.github/images/federated-gif.gif)

See setup [tutorial](https://www.github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/tutorials)

## AWS SSO
AWS SSO let create and manage user identities in AWS SSOâ€™s identity store, easily 
connect to existing identity source, including Microsoft Active Directory, Okta Universal Directory, 
and Azure AD. Finally, trough Leapp, Developers have access to all their sessions from one tool.

See setup [tutorial](https://www.github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/tutorials)

## AWS Truster Access
Federating each account is difficult so use truster accounts to grant access easier and painlessly.
We use federated role as a gateway to all trusted roles in all other AWS accounts.
In this access strategy a **truster role** is assumed by a **federated role**.

![Truster Access Use-case](.github/images/truster-gif.gif)

See setup [tutorial](https://www.github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/tutorials)

*Note: it's possible to apply MFA to a truster session by setting it on the plain account it relies on. Please see [MFA section](#multi-factor-authentication) for more details.*

## Azure Access
Use Leapp to do Single Sign On with G Suite on Azure to get access to your 
**Subscriptions**. In this use case is **mandatory** to have defined a Federation 
between Google and Azure. Leapp manage the login process for you to have Azure CLI 
ready to be used.
