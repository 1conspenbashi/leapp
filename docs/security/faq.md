### Can someone else access my data?
**NO.** All the information you put in Leapp are stored encrypted inside your workstation. Nothing is saved or transmitted online.

### I don't feel secure using a built-in window for authentication, can't you use the default browser?
In the future Leapp will only use the default browser to authenticate. Right now it's a compromise to deliver the authentication flow. We already ported AWS SSO authentication flow on the default browser, and we're working toward migrating the other ones.

### How can I find Leapp data in the System Vault?

Every key stored by Leapp in the vault is named Leapp. The account name shows the description of the element saved by our software.
