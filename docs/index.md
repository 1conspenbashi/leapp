# Overview

## Welcome to Leapp :rocket:

Leapp is a tool for developers to manage, secure, and access to the Cloud.

Leapp information needed to retrieve credentials are stored **LOCALLY** inside his [workspace](concepts.md). Critical information such as Cloud secrets and token are stored inside the **System Vault**.

The name **Leapp** is inspired by the English word *leap* and pronounced */l:ip/*. We choose this name because the project enables you to be one step away from your cloud environments.
