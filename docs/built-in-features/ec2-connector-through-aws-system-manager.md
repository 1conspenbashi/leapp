Leapp gives the possibility to connect to an AWS EC2 instance through SSM if correctly configured in your AWS account.
To do so, select a suitable session, which refers to  a suitable set of permissions in the **session list**. 
Click on the contextual menu, and select SSM Session.

Here you can select the **AWS region**, and if granted the right permissions, you'll be able to select the instance to connect to.

!!! Info

    If the user is not granted the right permissions, the operation will fail and Leapp will give an error message showing the reason.
