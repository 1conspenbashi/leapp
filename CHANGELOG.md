### [0.5.3](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3) (2021-05-11)


### Features

* updater system has been completely rewritten from scratch with the ability to manually install a new update without letting Leapp install it on your behalf. If someone prefers to stick to a specific version, it can be done, by using the "remind me later" button, which mute update notifications until the next release.
